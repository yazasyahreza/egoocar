This is my individual project for my final exam at school to create an e-commerce website for a car dealership. It is designed using PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap technologies. The website is also divided into two systems: an administrator system and a landing page display.

On the administrator page, you can perform CRUD operations to manage the product data that will be displayed on the landing page.

On the landing page, you can interact with the website, such as viewing car types by category or brand and accessing information like the store profile, types of cars, and their prices.
