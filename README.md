This project is a car dealership e-commerce website developed as my final exam assignment using PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap. The system consists of two components:

- Admin Panel: Provides CRUD functionality for managing car data, including adding, updating, and deleting listings.
- Landing Page: Offers an interactive interface where users can explore car models by brand or category and view detailed information such as pricing and store profiles.

The project highlights my understanding of frontend–backend integration, database design, and responsive UI implementation.
